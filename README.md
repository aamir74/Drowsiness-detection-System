# Drowsiness-detection-System
Aim of this project is to implement the system by capturing the live images (video) of the eyes and fed them in our system which will then process the video and convert it into frames and process it accordingly.â€‹

On the whole, by sensing the eye blinks and it's duration we can decide whether the driver is drowsy or not and can sound alarm accordingly.
